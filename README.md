### Deployment
The application uses python with a virtual environment and runs with the Flask WSGI. Settings can be managed via the `.flaskenv` or `config.py` configuration.
- The default configuration binds to `127.0.0.1` on port `8000`, update the `FLASK_RUN_HOST` and `FLASK_RUN_PORT` as necessary.
- We assume you are in the working directory or know the relative path.

Linux/MacOS:
```
# Congigure Envionment and Dependencies 
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
./venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt

# Deploy
./venv/bin/flask run 
```

Windows:
```
# Congigure Envionment and Dependencies 
python -m venv venv
source venv/Scripts/activate
.\venv\Scripts\pip.exe install -r requirements.txt

# Deploy
.\venv\Scripts\flask.exe run
```

### Testing
The application includes unit testing and headless selenium testing, this is available in `/testing` and `/testing/selenium`.

##### Unit Tests
To conduct unit tests ensure the dependencies are installed via venv as instructed by deployment, then use the python module `unittest` in the `/testing` directory.
```
./venv/bin/python3 -m unittest
```

##### Selenium
Our testing uses the Chrome webdriver, ensure Google Chrome is installed.
- These tests are written only for Unix
Use the Virutal Envionment from Deployment from prior:
```
./venv/bin/pip install -r /testing/selenium/requirements.txt
./venv/bin/python3 testing/selenium/test.py
```
- If the tests fail due to a slow browser, try increasing the `DELAY`
